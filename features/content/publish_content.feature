Feature: Publish content

  As a user
  I want to publish content
  So that users can find it on a specific location
  
  Background:
    Given I have an account
      And I have signed in
  
  # Scenario: Share content to location
  #   When I share content to <location>
  #   Then it shows up on <location>
  #   | location  | path              |
  #   | home      | home_path         |
  #   | global    | global_wall_path  |
